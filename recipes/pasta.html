    <h2>Description</h2>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>¼ cup olive oil</li>
      <li>½ shallot, finely chopped</li>
      <li>1 small garlic clove, finely grated</li>
      <li>½ cup tomato paste</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons vodka</li>
      <li>1 cup heavy cream</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes</li>
      <li>Kosher salt, freshly ground pepper</li>
      <li>1 pound fusilli</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
      <li>1 ounce finely grated Parmesan, plus more for serving</li>
      <li>¼ cup chopped fresh basil</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Heat oil in a large skillet over medium. Add shallot and garlic and
        cook, stirring occasionally, until softened, about 5 minutes. Add tomato
        paste and cook, stirring occasionally, until paste is brick red and
        starts to caramelize, about 5 minutes. <br />
        Add vodka and cook, stirring constantly, until liquid is mostly
        evaporated, about 2 minutes. Add cream and red pepper flakes and stir
        until well blended. Season with salt and pepper; remove from heat.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        Meanwhile, cook pasta in a large pot of boiling salted water, stirring
        occasionally, until al dente. Drain, reserving 1 cup pasta cooking
        liquid. Add pasta to skillet with sauce along with butter and ½ cup
        pasta cooking liquid. <br />
        Cook over medium-low heat, stirring constantly and adding more pasta
        cooking liquid if needed, until butter has melted and a thick, glossy
        sauce has formed, about 2 minutes. <br />
        Season with salt and pepper and add 1 oz. Parmesan, tossing to coat.
        Divide pasta among bowls, then top with basil and more Parmesan.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>Do Ahead: Vodka sauce can be made 5 days ahead; cover and chill.</li>
