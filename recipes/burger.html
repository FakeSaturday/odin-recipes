    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Pizza burgers are just so fun and we want to make them every night of the
      week. These were born when we just couldn't decide between a pizza and
      burger and never wanted to make the decision again.
    </p>

        divided
      </li>
      <li>4 slices mozzarella</li>
      <li>12 pepperoni slices</li>
      <li>4 Kaiser rolls (or hamburger buns)</li>
      <li>2 tbsp. melted butter</li>
      <li>2 tsp. garlic powder</li>
      <li>1 tsp. Italian seasoning</li>
      <li>1/4 c. freshly grated Parmesan</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Step 1 Preheat oven to 350Â°. In a medium bowl, combine ground beef,
        garlic and parsley and mix with spatula until just combined. Using your
        hands, form 4 equally-sized patties; season both sides with salt and
        pepper.
      </li>
      <li>
        Step 2 Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add burgers
        and cook, 4 to 5 minutes for medium. Flip patties, then immediately pour
        2 cups marinara around them in pan. <br />
        Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer for another minute, then top each
        with cheese and pepperoni slices. Cover pan and cook until cheese is
        melty and burger is cooked to your liking, about 3 minutes more.
      </li>
      <li>
        Step 3 Meanwhile, make garlic buns. Brush melted butter on inside of
        each half of the rolls and sprinkle with garlic powder, Italian
        seasoning, and Parmesan. Bake until golden, about 10 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Step 4 Spread remaining 1/2 cup marinara on bottom buns followed by
        cooked burgers and the top bun halves.
